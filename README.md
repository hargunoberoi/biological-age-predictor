# Age Predictor Application

This repository contains a full-stack application for predicting age based on health and demographic features. The application consists of a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.

## Features

- Collapsible form interface for entering health metrics
- Image upload and autofill functionality using OpenAI vision models
  - Upload medical reports/documents as PNG images
  - AI-powered automatic extraction of health metrics from images
  - Highlighted indicators for fields that need manual entry
- Age prediction using a neural network model
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile views

## How It Works

1. **Health Metrics Entry**: Fill out a form with your health metrics such as height, weight, blood pressure, etc.
   - The form is collapsible to reduce visual clutter
   - All fields are neatly organized and categorized
2. **AI-Powered Document Analysis**: Upload a medical report or document as a PNG image

   - Click "Autofill" to extract health metrics automatically
   - The system will highlight which fields were successfully extracted and which need manual entry
   - Verify and complete any missing information

3. **Biological Age Prediction**: Submit your health data to receive a prediction of your biological age
   - The prediction is generated by a neural network model trained on health and demographic data
   - Results are presented with a clear visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- OpenAI API Key (for image analysis feature)

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker Compose, which will set up both the frontend and backend services in containers.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- OpenAI API Key (for image analysis feature)

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Navigate to the app directory:

   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. Create your environment file (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to add your actual OpenAI API key
   ```

3. Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application:

   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

5. To stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Docker Container Details

The application consists of two Docker containers:

1. **Backend (age-predictor-backend)**

   - FastAPI server running on port 8000
   - Provides the prediction API
   - Health check endpoint at /health

2. **Frontend (age-predictor-frontend)**
   - Next.js application running on port 3000
   - User interface for the age prediction service
   - Communicates with the backend API

## Local Development Setup

If you prefer to run the application without Docker for development purposes, follow these instructions:

### Backend (FastAPI)

The backend is built with FastAPI, providing a RESTful API for age prediction.

#### Features

- RESTful API for age prediction
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Health check endpoint
- Neural network model for age prediction

#### API Endpoints

- `POST /predict`: Predicts age based on input features
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint

#### Technologies Used

- FastAPI
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

#### Running the Backend

There are two ways to run the backend:

1. **Using the root endpoint.py file**:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Start the server from the project root
   uvicorn endpoint:app --reload
   ```

2. **Using the app/backend/endpoint.py file**:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd app/backend

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Start the server
   uvicorn endpoint:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000 and the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the age prediction model.

### Features

- Form for inputting health and demographic data
- Display of prediction results
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- Axios for API requests
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Running the Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Model Information

The age prediction model is a neural network trained on health and demographic data. The model is defined in `model.py` and the trained weights are stored in `age_predictor.pth`.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

#### For Local Development

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

#### For Docker Deployment

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the app directory:

   ```bash
   cd app
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run Docker Compose with the .env file:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   Note: No need to specify `--env-file .env` as it will automatically look for a .env file in the current directory.
