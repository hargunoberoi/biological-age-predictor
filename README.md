# Age Prediction from Health Metrics

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates the training and inference of a neural network model designed to predict a person's age based on common health metrics.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a synthetic dataset that contains various health-related features for age prediction.

**Data Source:** [Human Age Prediction Synthetic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/human-age-prediction-synthetic-dataset) on Kaggle.

**Google-colab notebook** You can also find the entire implementation at this [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PMDkkCiwqRIsOdbo4zhyfLPnI4n9O0_C?usp=sharing)
